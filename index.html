    Talking and chatting with you these past few weeks has been so fun. 
    It’s also been really fun playing with you — and somewhere along the way, 
    I realized something deep inside me… my feelings for you never really left since February.

    I know you’re focused on your studies right now, and I truly respect that. 
    But I also just want to be honest about how I feel. Every time I get to talk to you or play with you, 
    I can’t help but smile. I’m genuinely happy, and it’s been so long since I’ve felt this way.

    I’m not rushing anything — I know your priorities, and I admire that about you. 
    I just want you to know that I’ll be here, and I’m willing to wait patiently until you’re ready.
