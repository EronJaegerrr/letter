    <h1>Good Evening, Julliane Mau! Odette Godz <span class="heart">❤️</span></h1>
    <p>
      I just wanted to say that talking and chatting with you these past few weeks has been so fun. 
      It’s also been really fun playing with you — and somewhere along the way, I realized something 
      deep inside me… my feelings for you never really left since February.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know you’re focused on your studies right now, and I truly respect that. 
      But I also just want to be honest about how I feel. Every time I get to talk to you or play with you, 
      I can’t help but smile. I’m genuinely happy, and it’s been so long since I’ve felt this way.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m not rushing anything — I know your priorities, and I admire that about you. 
      I just want you to know that I’ll be here, and I’m willing to wait patiently until you’re ready.
    </p>
