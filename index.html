      <h2>Good Evening, Julliane Mau! Odette Godz!!!</h2>
      <p>
        I just wanted to say that talking and chatting with you these past few weeks has been so fun.  
        It’s also been really fun playing with you — and somewhere along the way, I realized something deep inside me… my feelings for you never really left since February.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know you’re focused on your studies right now, and I truly respect that. But I also just want to be honest about how I feel. Every time I get to talk to you or play with you, I can’t help but smile.  
        I’m genuinely happy, and it’s been so long since I’ve felt this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not rushing anything — I know your priorities, and I admire that about you. I just want you to know that I’ll be here, and I’m willing to wait patiently until you’re ready.
      </p>
